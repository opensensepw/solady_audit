# Solwaifu Audit
## Introduction
 **Kick-off Meeting**: Start with a kick-off meeting to introduce the audit, the files in the repository, the timeline, and the expected deliverables. Explain the process and what the participants are expected to do each week.
    
**Weekly Files Review**: Assign around 8 files for everyone to audit per week. Ensure that there's a diverse mix of file complexity each week to maintain participant engagement and interest.
    
**Weekly Discussion Sessions**: Schedule weekly sessions where all participants can discuss their findings, potential vulnerabilities, and suggestions for improvement. These can be in the form of open forums, breakout sessions, or round-table discussions.
    
**Deliverables**: At the end of each week, participants can document their findings, suggestions, and any other relevant information. This will make it easier for everyone to keep track of the progress and understand the audit trail.
    
**Closing Meeting**: Once all files have been audited, hold a closing meeting to summarize the findings, acknowledge everyone's efforts, and discuss the next steps.
